# chess-learner
 A novice attempt at a reinforcement learning chess bot in python using gym-chess and tensorflow. First off, make sure you unzip the engines folder. To start training, simply run agent_trainer.py and follow the prompts. (You'll have to supply your own uci compatable engines and paths if you want to use something other than stockfish)
